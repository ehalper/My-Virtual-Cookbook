# Virtual Cookbook Web Application
## https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PS8Z7Lo_y4

The web application allows users to find new recipes while taking any food intolerances they may have into account, using the Spoonacular API. The user will specify any dietary restrictions, how many recipe results they want to see, and the kind of food they are querying. In addition, the user is able 
to save recipes they want to keep, and they are able to view all of their saved recipes (as well as delete) using MongoDB.
